          Born and raised in Illinois, Davis left his studies at the Juilliard School in New York
          City and made his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker&apos;s
          bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the Birth of the Cool sessions
          for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early
          1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records
          but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback
          performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with
          Columbia Records and recorded the 1957 album &apos;Round About Midnight.[2] It was his
          first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the
          sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral
          jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish-influenced Sketches of
          Spain (1960), and band recordings, such as Milestones (1958) and Kind of Blue (1959).
